## Project Description

This project automates the process of managing Excel data by integrating local Excel files with Google Drive. It involves receiving Excel files containing various types of information, processing this data, and subsequently creating and updating formatted Excel sheets on Google Drive. The primary goal is to streamline the workflow, ensuring that data from local sources is efficiently transferred and organized in a cloud-based environment, making it accessible and manageable for further use.

### Key Features

- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly receive and process Excel files from local storage.
- **Automated Formatting:** Create standardized and formatted Excel sheets on Google Drive.
- **Data Updates:** Regularly update existing Google Drive Excel sheets with new data.
- **Cloud Accessibility:** Ensure data is accessible from anywhere with Google Drive.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage issues during data processing and uploading.

## Objective

Create and update Excel sheets on Google Drive with data sourced from local Excel files.

### Technologies

- **Excel Sets API:** Utilized for efficient handling and processing of Excel data.
- **Drive API:** Used to create, update, and manage Excel sheets on Google Drive.

### Methodology

1. **Folder Setup:** To make the program work, you will need to create two folders:
    - One on your local drive (C:).
    - Another on your Google Drive.

2. **API Licensing:** Be aware that failures may occur due to API license problems. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and licenses for both the Excel Sets API and the Drive API.

By leveraging this system, users can maintain an organized and up-to-date repository of Excel sheets on Google Drive, enhancing productivity and data management efficiency.
